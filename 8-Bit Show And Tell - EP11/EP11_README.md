This is the code from exploring integer optimizations video<br />
each .bas is stored in a .D64 image for easy use as well as the seperate text versions<br />
NOTE: 
test 9 & 10 require the use of the petscii PI character ($9e) which could not be put
into an ISO or UTF text file (by me anyways) so you will need to correct that to run them.
