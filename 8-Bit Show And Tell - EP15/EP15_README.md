This is the code from Even More Commodore 64 BASIC Optimizations episode<br />
each .bas is stored in a .D64 image for easy use as well as the seperate text versions<br />
NOTE: 
test 6 & 7 contain the Pi symbol from PETSCII and I cannot recreate that in UTF-8, so they were not converted to text
<br />
