This is the code from the animated directory example<br />
This is stored as a .D64 because some of the data in the BASIC program cannot be>br />
recreated outside the C64 / emulator.  the disk contains the code Robin generated.<br />
**CREATE.BAS** which can be loaded using **load "create.bas",8**<br />
doing a list on the directory shows more or less the effect that it was meant to create.<br />
however I did NOT go through the process of removing the ugly artifacts with Fast Hack'em but the tool<br />
is available for [downloaded here](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=66091)
